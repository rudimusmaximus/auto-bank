== PURPOSE
[.text-center]
*_Create single yaml bank file from a directory with one or more sf2 files._*

This is in beta and is currently a work in progress.

== How to Use
. Make sure the setup steps are complete
. Create a directory named what you want the bank file to be called (ex. "my_bank")
. Place one or more SF2 files in that directory
. Open terminal inside the new directory
. Type command **bun -b run auto_bank_bun.js**
. You should see an output file called `my_bank.yaml` (name after your directory)
. Test it with fluidsynth or your favorite hardware synth
. If it's affordable for you, consider a donation if I saved you time :) Here's to the music!

== Donations

TODO setup ways to donate - cash.app, buymeacoffee.com

TODO if there's interest, consider moving this project to a drag and drop web app.

== Setup Steps
*Note:* This project depends on both Bun (for JavaScript) and Python 3 (for `.sf2` parsing).

. Install https://bun.sh[**Bun**] if you haven’t already
. Install Python 3
. Install the Python library **sf2utils** (used for parsing SF2 files). If your goal is “install once and just have it work anywhere,” then a global or user-level install is fine:
+
----
pip install --user sf2utils
----
Note: this is the version on gitlab https://gitlab.com/zeograd/sf2utils
Confirm this with `pip show sf2utils` command.
. Optionally, ensure your environment is set up so `python3 parse_sf2.py --file yourFont.sf2` runs properly or simply continue with the how-to-use instructions above.

**We're Using GitHub Under Protest**
For our organization, we only use GitHub for private repositories.  We do not recommend it for public or open source work.

We urge you to read about the https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/[Give up GitHub campaign] from https://sfconservancy.org[the Software Freedom Conservancy] to understand
some reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

We are considering https://about.gitlab.com[GitLab] for any open source work we might do in the future.
