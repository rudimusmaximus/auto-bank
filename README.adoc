== PURPOSE
[.text-center]
*_Create single yaml bank file from a directory with one or more sf2 files._*

This is in beta and is currently a work in progress.

== How to Use
. Make sure the setup steps are complete
. Create a directory named what you want the bank file to be called (ex. "my_bank")
. Place one or more SF2 files in that directory
. Open terminal inside the new directory
. Type command **bun -b run auto_bank_bun.js**
. You should see an output file called `my_bank.yaml` (name after your directory)
. Test it with fluidsynth or your favorite hardware synth
. If it's affordable for you, consider a donation if I saved you time :) Here's to the music!

== Donations

TODO setup ways to donate - cash.app, buymeacoffee.com

TODO if there's interest, consider moving this project to a drag and drop web app.

== Setup Steps
*Note:* This project depends on both Bun (for JavaScript) and Python 3 (for `.sf2` parsing).

. Install https://bun.sh[**Bun**] if you haven’t already
. Install Python 3
. Install the Python library **sf2utils** (used for parsing SF2 files). If your goal is “install once and just have it work anywhere,” then a global or user-level install is fine:
+
----
pip install --user sf2utils
----
Note: this is the version on gitlab https://gitlab.com/zeograd/sf2utils
Confirm this with `pip show sf2utils` command.
. Optionally, ensure your environment is set up so `python3 parse_sf2.py --file yourFont.sf2` runs properly or simply continue with the how-to-use instructions above.

= Fluidpatcher SF2 Integration Notes
:source-note: ChatGPT on 2025-01-22

This document provides an overview of how Fluidpatcher consumes `.sf2` (SoundFont) files and what data is needed in a Fluidpatcher bank file. It includes guidance on which SF2 metadata is relevant, how to structure your `patches:` in YAML, and how to merge these automatically generated presets with a “base” YAML that contains global settings or template data.

== Overview

1. Fluidpatcher only cares about certain information from each `.sf2`:
   - **Soundfont path** (or filename)
   - **Bank number**
   - **Preset (program) number**

2. All other SF2 details (e.g., velocity layers, sample regions, loop points) are **internal** to fluidsynth. Fluidpatcher does not require them.

3. The YAML structure under `patches:` is mostly up to the user. Each patch can have multiple channel assignments, advanced router rules, messages, etc. The minimum is something like:

----
patches:
  PatchName:
    1: SomeSoundFont.sf2:000:000
----

4. The keys you use for grouping (like `PatchName`) do not need to exactly match the SF2’s preset name. You can rename or reorganize them as you see fit.

== Valid Nodes in Fluidpatcher

- **Top-level keys** recognized by Fluidpatcher include:
  - `patches:` (required if you want any playable patches)
  - `router_rules:`
  - `fluidsettings:` (only `synth.*` keys have an effect)
  - `init:` (which may contain `fluidsettings:` and `messages:`)
  - Additional fields like `description:`, `about bank vs patch level:`, etc., can be added for clarity or documentation.

- **Per-patch keys** can include:
  - `router_rules:`
  - `messages:`
  - `ladspafx:`
  - `sequencers:`
  - `arpeggiators:`
  - `midiplayers:`
  - or any other free-form keys like `info:`, `comment:`, etc.

Consult the Fluidpatcher wiki for full details on each feature: https://github.com/albedozero/fluidpatcher/wiki

== Recommendation

- Generate only the minimal needed info from the `.sf2`: `(filename):(bank):(preset)`.
- Use the SF2’s preset name or a custom label as the key under `patches:`.
- Add Fluidpatcher-specific nodes (like `router_rules`) only if needed.
- Store your global or template data (for example, `init:`, `fluidsettings:`, master `router_rules:`) in a separate “base” YAML and merge your `.sf2`-generated patches into it.

If at a later time you find additional SF2 metadata to be relevant, you can enhance the parsing script. Typically, for Fluidpatcher usage, SF2 “bank + preset + optional name” is sufficient.

== Final Solution Based on This Discussion

Below are example files illustrating one possible setup. You can adjust paths and filenames as needed.

=== 1. `parse_sf2.py`

----
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import argparse
import json
import sys
from sf2utils.sf2parse import Sf2File

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("--file", required=True, help="Path to the .sf2 file")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    sf2_path = args.file
    try:
        with open(sf2_path, 'rb') as sf2_file:
            sf2 = Sf2File(sf2_file)

            presets_info = []
            for p in sf2.presets:
                if hasattr(p, 'preset') and hasattr(p, 'bank'):
                    presets_info.append({
                        "name": p.name,
                        "preset": p.preset,
                        "bank": p.bank,
                    })
            print(json.dumps(presets_info))

    except Exception as e:
        print(str(e), file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
----

This Python script reads a `.sf2` file, extracts each preset’s name, bank, and preset number, and prints them as JSON. It is used by the Bun script to gather data for the final YAML.

=== 2. `base_bank.yaml`

(This file contains your global or “template” data, including example patches and top-level settings. You can customize or remove any keys you do not need.)

----
description: This is an example base bank for Fluidpatcher
note: "Add disclaimers or helpful text here"
patches:
  Example Patch:
    info: This is a manually defined patch to demonstrate merging
    1: Example.sf2:000:000

fluidsettings:
  synth.reverb.width: 0.5

router_rules:
- {type: cc, chan: 1=2-16, par1: 7}
- {type: pbend, chan: 1=3}

init:
  fluidsettings:
    synth.reverb.room-size: 0.8
  messages:
  - cc:3:11:50
  - cc:4:11:50
----

=== 3. `auto_bank_bun.js`

----
#!/usr/bin/env bun

import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";
import yaml from "js-yaml";
import { $ } from "bun";

// 1) parseSf2File function to call Python parser
async function parseSf2File(sf2FilePath) {
  const { stdout, stderr, exitCode } = await $`python3 parse_sf2.py --file ${sf2FilePath}`;
  if (exitCode !== 0) {
    throw new Error(stderr.trim() || \`Failed to parse \${sf2FilePath}\`);
  }
  return JSON.parse(stdout);
}

// 2) Main function
async function generateBankFile() {
  const dirName = path.basename(process.cwd());

  // Load the base YAML template
  const baseYaml = fs.readFileSync("base_bank.yaml", "utf8");
  let finalData = yaml.load(baseYaml);

  // Ensure patches key exists
  if (!finalData.patches) {
    finalData.patches = {};
  }

  // Find all SF2 files
  const sf2Files = fs
    .readdirSync(".")
    .filter((f) => f.toLowerCase().endsWith(".sf2"));

  if (!sf2Files.length) {
    throw new Error("No SF2 files found in the directory.");
  }

  const logEntries = [];

  // For each SF2, parse and add presets
  for (const sf2File of sf2Files) {
    try {
      const presets = await parseSf2File(sf2File);
      if (!presets || presets.length === 0) {
        logEntries.push(\`Skipped \${sf2File}: No presets found.\`);
        continue;
      }

      const patchIndexCounts = {};
      for (const preset of presets) {
        const presetName = preset.name || "Unnamed";
        const presetNum = preset.preset;
        const bankNum = preset.bank;

        if (!finalData.patches[presetName]) {
          finalData.patches[presetName] = {};
          patchIndexCounts[presetName] = 1;
        }

        const leftKey = String(patchIndexCounts[presetName]++);
        const presetStr = String(presetNum).padStart(3, '0');
        const bankStr = String(bankNum).padStart(3, '0');
        const rightVal = \`\${sf2File}:\${presetStr}:\${bankStr}\`;

        finalData.patches[presetName][leftKey] = rightVal;
      }

      logEntries.push(\`Processed \${sf2File}\`);
    } catch (err) {
      logEntries.push(\`Skipped \${sf2File}: \${err.message}\`);
    }
  }

  // Write final YAML
  const outYamlName = \`\${dirName}.yaml\`;
  const yamlStr = yaml.dump(finalData, { indent: 2 });
  fs.writeFileSync(outYamlName, yamlStr, "utf8");

  // Write log file
  fs.writeFileSync("auto_bank_run_log.txt", logEntries.join("\n"), "utf8");

  console.log(\`Done! Wrote \${outYamlName} and auto_bank_run_log.txt\`);
}

// 3) Execute
generateBankFile().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
----

== How to Use

1. Place `parse_sf2.py`, `base_bank.yaml`, and `auto_bank_bun.js` in the same directory.
2. Add your `.sf2` files to the directory.
3. Run:

----
bun run auto_bank_bun.js
----

4. The script will:
   - Load `base_bank.yaml` as the foundation.
   - Detect `.sf2` files in the current directory.
   - Call `parse_sf2.py` to extract presets from each `.sf2`.
   - Merge them into the `patches:` section of the base YAML.
   - Write out `<currentDirName>.yaml` and `auto_bank_run_log.txt`.

That’s it! You now have a valid Fluidpatcher bank file with your base configuration **and** any automatically generated `.sf2` patches.
